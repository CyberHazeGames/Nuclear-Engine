## Requirements
- __OpenGL__
  - OpenGL 3.3 Core capable GPU with the required extensions (all became core in later versions):
    - Required for Separate Shaders:

	  - GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects

- __DirectX__
  - DirectX 10.1 capable GPU.
  - DirectX 11 runtime DLLS.

## Features:
- __Core__
  - Cross platform ready
  - Modern Fast code using C++

  - Cross-platform Application creation through GLFW.
  - All of error prone calls (as Resource creation or loading) are being logged.
  - Support for XML & INI Parsers.
  
- __AssetManager__
  - Support for PNG, JPEG, BMP, DDS, GIF, HDR, PSD and many more image formats (using stb_image library).
  - Support for OBJ, FBX, Blend, 3DS, CAD, GLtf and many more 3D model formats (using Assimp library).
  - Multi-Thread loading (Soonâ„¢)
  
- __ShaderManager__
  - Support for automated shader creation instead of Re-Writing them
  
- __Audio__
  - Support for FMOD.

- __Graphics__

  - Support for Point, Bilinear, Tri-linear, Anisotropic "X2, X4, X8, X16", Filtering for Textures.
  - Support for HLSL Shaders which can be Cross Compiled to GLSL.
  - Support for Separate Shaders (Vertex & Pixel).
  - Support for Separate Samplers and Textures.
  - Support for Customized Dear-ImGui as a Default GUI Library.
  
  - ___RenderSystem___
    - Support for BlinnPhong Lighting.
    - Support for Normal Mapping.
    - Support for PostProcessing Effects:
	  - Gamma Correction
	  - HDR 'Reinhard tone mapping'
  
## Current Platforms
  - Windows 7+     

## Currently TODO
  - Implement PhysXEngine (Nvidia Physics)
  - Multi-thread crucial sub-systems.
  - Implement WYSIWYG Editor.
  - Implement Class based GUI from ImGui.
  
### Building
Please See NuclearDeps Repo for dependencies.
Currently I am using Visual Studio 2017 to build it.
