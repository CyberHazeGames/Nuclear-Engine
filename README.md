## Requirements
- __OpenGL__
  - OpenGL 3.3 Core capable GPU with the required extensions (all became core in later versions):
    - Required for Separate Shaders:	
	  - GL_ARB_shading_language_420pack
	  - GL_ARB_separate_shader_objects

- __DirectX__
  - DirectX 10.1 capable GPU.
  - DirectX 11 runtime DLLS.

## Features:-1
- __Core__
  - Cross platform ready
  - Modern Fast code using C++
  - Fast Robust Entity Component System "ECS" using EntityX.
  - Cross-platform Application creation through GLFW.
  - All of error prone calls (as Resource creation or loading) are being logged.
  
- __Architecture__
  - All frequently called API functions and classes are 100% allocated on the Stack.
  - Design allows you to take advantage of its flexibility and define your own RenderAPIs!
  - No Dynamic Inheritance or slow Function Pointers in any API call!
  
- __AssetManager__
  - Support for PNG, JPEG, BMP, DDS, GIF, HDR, PSD and many more image formats (using stb_image library).
  - Support for OBJ, FBX, Blend, 3DS, CAD, GLtf and many more 3D model formats (using Assimp library).
  - Multi-Thread loading (Soonâ„¢)
  
- __ShaderManager__
  - Support for automated shader creation instead of Re-Writing them
  
- __Audio__
  - Support for FMOD low level API.
  
- __Graphics__
  - Support for DirectX 11 "Feature Level 10.1" and OpenGL 3.3 Core RenderAPIs.
  - Support for Point, Bilinear, Tri-linear, Anisotropic "X2, X4, X8, X16", Filtering for Textures.
  - Support for HLSL Shaders which can be Cross Compiled to GLSL.
  - Support for Separate Shaders (Vertex & Pixel).
  - Support for Separate Samplers and Textures.
  - Fastest Design Possible through If statements in debug build and direct RenderAPI calls in release build.
  - ___RenderSystem___
    - Support for BlinnPhong Lighting.
    - Support for Normal Mapping.
    - Support for PostProcessing Effects:
	  - Gamma Correction
	  - HDR 'Reinhard tone mapping'
    - Support for IMGUI.
  
## Current Platforms
  - Windows 7+     

## Currently TODO
  - Implement PhysXEngine (Nvidia Physics)
  - PostProcessing Effects:
	- Bloom
  - Finish 2D Renderering:
    - Sprite
	- SpriteRenderer
  - Implement Retained-Mode GUI.
  - Implement multithread AssetManager.
  
## Road-map
  - Support Android & Linux & UWP Platforms.
  - Support an Uber Shader instead of GLSL , HLSL.
  - Support scripting using 'C#' mono-script or 'C++' AngelScript.
  - There are more but these are the most important... (look at the soon features...)
  
  
### Building
Please See NuclearDeps Repo for dependencies.
Currently I am using Visual Studio 2017 15.5.5 to build it.
